		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Alec Byrd</p>
		<p>I am a Freshman at Miami University</p>
		<p style="color: salmon">My favorite color is Salmon</p>
		<p style="width: 40%;">I unfortunately play League of Legends. I play in the club for Miami and my team is really quite bad. We are currently 0-8. Also I was really good at Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock at the age of 3.  It is probably the point I peaked in life.</p>
		<p style="width: 40%;">I am from the Chicago area, and I have one sister.  Her name is Meredith. She is like me, but the opposite, and fun. She encourages me to do bad things somewhat frequently but she is chill nonetheless.  Sometimes I knock on her door and just hear a groan in response.  One time, she stole my phone from me, and while saying crunch, bit down cracking my screen badly from the bottom right corner to the center of the screen.  She is 3 years older than me.
